Diamond Dash Bot

This is a bot for the facebook version of the game Diamond Dash.
Requires the libraries autopy and WConio (just for clearing the
screen, you can replace it with `os.system('cls')` but it'll be
slower.).

Current high score is about 1 million points, a little higher if
you disable clicking on the Diamonds.
